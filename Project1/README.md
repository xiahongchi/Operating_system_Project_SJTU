# Operating System Project 1 
--- Done by xiahongchi

## About the files submitted
* Each folder is correspond to a problem, see ./Problemx/ to  get the files I submit to problem x.
* In ./Problem1/ I have submitted the Makefile of the module and the source code sys_ptree.c which has implemented the system call pstree in Android.
* In ./Problem2/ I have submitted ptree.c and Android.mk. The first one is a test program's source code, which is designed to test system call pstree, And the second one is the Makefile of the source code.
* In ./Problem3/ I have submitted ptree_pchr.c and Android.mk. The first one is a test program's source code, which is designed to test system call pstree and show the parent-child relationship in the system call pstree, And the second one is the Makefile of the source code.
* In ./Problem4/ I have submitted five source code and a Makefile of them. The file client.c and server.c are the main entry of client and server program, and server.h and general.h contain some package functions and auxiliary tool functions for the previous two source files, And the Makefile and complie the two program together successfully.

>Notes: I have noticed that the file "CS2303prj1.pdf" says that only two files server.c and client.c are needed in Problem 4, but in my opinion, TOO MANY PACKAGE FUNCTIONS AND TOOL FUNCTIONS WRITTEN IN ONLY ONE .C FILE MAKES THE READABILITY WORSE, so I decide to take it apart from .c files and create .h files.
* In ./Problem2/testscript/, ./Problem3/testscript/, ./Problem4/testscript/, the testscript of the corresponding problem is saved,
including a screenshot(\*.png) and a raw text(\*.txt).
